[![fastlane Plugin Badge](https://rawcdn.githack.com/fastlane/fastlane/master/fastlane/assets/plugin-badge.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/fastlane-plugin-instrumented_tests)

## Getting Started

This project is a [fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) plugin. To get started with `fastlane-plugin-instrumented_tests`, add it to your project by running:

```bash
fastlane add_plugin instrumented_tests
```

## About instrumented_tests

Run instrumented tests for android. 

This basically creates and boots an emulator before running gradle commands so that you can run instrumented tests against that emulator. After the gradle command is executed, the avd gets shut down and deleted. This is really helpful on CI services, keeping them clean and always having a fresh avd for testing.

## Example

Check out the [example `Fastfile`](fastlane/Fastfile) to see how to use this plugin. Try it by cloning the repo, running `fastlane install_plugins` and `bundle exec fastlane test`. 

Creates and boots avd device before running gradle command.

```ruby
instrumented_tests(
  avd_name: "Nexus_5_API_25_Test",
  avd_package: "'system-images;android-19;google_apis;x86'",
  avd_abi: "google_apis/x86",
)
```

## Run tests for this plugin

To run both the tests, and code style validation, run

```bash
rake
```

To automatically fix many of the styling issues, use 
```bash
